# 8_puzzle_A_star
8 puzzle using A* algorithm in Python, a university assignment.

If it gets stuck, just restart it. Some combinations take a lifetime with A*.

You can use it with some easy combinations that were already put in the code as
comments, or you can also use a custom input for it. It should be a 1d list and the empty tile should be ' '.
